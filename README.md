This K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) project template guides users through building a classification model. It includes steps for data loading, exploratory analysis with pairplots, feature standardization using StandardScaler, data splitting, model training, and evaluation. The project emphasizes finding the optimal K value via the elbow method and reassessing model performance with the chosen K.
